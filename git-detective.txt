The Git v2.39 Release notes mention a fix for a segmentation fault that occurred when using git merge-tree in read-only repositories. the tool attempted to create a merge result tree object, which failed but subsequently led to a segmentation fault, which was unintended behavior. 

To pinpoint the specific commit that addressed this issue, I followed these steps:
1. I examined the Git v2.39 release notes, which described the problem and indicated that it had been corrected.
2. I searched the Git commit history for relevant changes around the time of the release. This led me to commit 19118cb8570e499e1a56e81740cee3d1c1206b44, which merges the branch js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo.
3. The commit message for 19118cb8570e499e1a56e81740cee3d1c1206b44 states that in read only repositories, git merge-tree tried to come up with a merge result tree object, which it failed and it led to a segfault, which has been corrected.
